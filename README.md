# CDK Direct Credentials Plugin

This plugin serves as a way to skip CDK's credential resolution step in favour of using whatever the JavaScript SDK picks up as your environment's default. This way, it hooks in to defining your AWS profile in the standard manners, using `AWS_PROFILE` / `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` etc.
